/** 
 * <p>
 * This package implements a simplified version of the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)">Risk</a>. 
 * The moves are random possible moves and are not optimized in any way.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@code MinimalRisk} class provides an API consisting exclusively of static methods that accept 
 * as their first parameter the current state of the board in form of a JSON string and that return one of the following: 
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A JSON string representing the next state of the board,</li>
 *   <li>A JSON string representing a list of countries, or</li>
 *   <li>A boolean.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * As all methods are static and no object state is maintained between subsequent method calls this class
 * can serve as the basis for a simple stateless web API. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The implementation of the graph model and breadth-first search are based on Python code presented in 
 * <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/6-00-2x-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-3">MITx - 6.00.2x</a>.
